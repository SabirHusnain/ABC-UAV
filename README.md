# Underwater Vehicle Control System with PID Tuning

## Introduction
The underwater vehicle control system with PID tuning using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a MATLAB-based solution that allows for the optimization of control parameters for underwater vehicles. The system utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and the ABC algorithm to achieve accurate control and stability in various underwater conditions.

## Method
The control system consists of the following components:

1. `obFunc.m`: This MATLAB function calculates the response of the transfer function of the model for a given set of PID parameters. It serves as the objective function for the ABC algorithm.

2. `model.slx`: This Simulink model simulates the behavior of the underwater vehicle control system. It takes the optimized PID parameters as input and provides the simulation results.

3. `script.m`: This MATLAB script implements the ABC algorithm and tunes the PID parameters based on the `obFunc` objective function. It also automatically executes the `model.slx` Simulink model with the optimized PID parameters.

The ABC algorithm optimizes the PID parameters based on the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) cost function. The algorithm iteratively explores the parameter space, mimicking the foraging behavior of bees, to find the optimal PID parameters that minimize the IAE cost.

## Usage
To use the underwater vehicle control system with PID tuning and ABC algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that MATLAB is installed on your system.

2. Open the MATLAB environment and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.

3. Open the `script.m` file in the MATLAB editor.

4. Set the desired parameters for the ABC algorithm, such as the number of iterations, population size, and limits for PID parameters.

5. Run the `script.m` file in MATLAB to start the ABC algorithm.

6. The algorithm will iterate and tune the PID parameters based on the defined objective function (`obFunc`). The progress and results will be displayed in the MATLAB command window.

7. Once the algorithm completes, the optimized PID parameters will be obtained.

8. The `script.m` file will automatically execute the `model.slx` Simulink model using the optimized PID parameters.

9. The Simulink model will simulate the control system and display the results within the MATLAB environment or in separate windows.

10. Analyze the simulation results to evaluate the performance of the control system under different conditions.

11. Use the results to further fine-tune the control system if necessary.

## Conclusion
The underwater vehicle control system developed using PID tuning with the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm provides an effective approach for optimizing the control performance of an underwater vehicle. By iteratively adjusting the PID parameters based on the IAE cost function, the system achieves precise control and stability in various operating conditions. The provided MATLAB files (`obFunc.m` and `script.m`) allow users to implement the ABC algorithm and tune the PID parameters for their specific underwater vehicle control application. The `script.m` file automatically executes the `model.slx` Simulink model with the optimized PID parameters, enabling simulation and analysis of the control system's response within the MATLAB environment.

Please note that this is a general guide, and you may need to modify the code, parameters, and model according to your specific requirements and system dynamics.
